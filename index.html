            <p>When tough times made their rounds, I've always immeresed myself into those classic inspirational videos, or thoughtfully written quotes. I found them beneficial and supportive seeing that they can rapidly change your perspective; specifically in lessons that can sometimes take a lifetime to grasp.</p>
            <p>Below is a versatile collection of ultra-modern, "old-head", and consciously driven inspired quotes - some of the most heart-warming, but hard-bitten words, voiced by the most iconic. I hope that you enjoy, and can replenish yourself through inspiration and wisdom.</p>
            <p>"Even when you're fed up, you've got to keep your head up." - Tupac Shakur</p>
